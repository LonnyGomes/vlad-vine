## Photo Tips

Most modern smartphones and cameras automatically embed GPS data when you take photos (if location services are enabled). To check if your photo has GPS data:

- **On Mac**: Right-click photo → Get Info → More Info tab → Look for GPS coordinates
- **On Windows**: Right-click photo → Properties → Details tab → Look for GPS section
- **Online**: Use [exif.regex.info](https://exif.regex.info/exif.cgi) to check any photo

- ✅ Use `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.heic`, or `.tiff` formats
- ✅ Keep original filenames or use descriptive names (e.g., `bulbutin-paris-eiffel-tower.jpg`)
- ✅ Make sure GPS/location data is enabled on your camera/phone
- ✅ High-quality photos are preferred but not required
- 🎉 Have fun capturing Bulbutin's journey!
